# Kennisbank

A place to share system dynamics models for infrastructure innovation in the Netherlands.

Our partners solve infrastructure problems, sometimes system dynamic models: improve our understnading the problems, identify what drives the system to change (dynamics), and formulate effective solutions.
These partners deposit some of these models in our Kennisbank (knowledge bank) to facilitate collaboration and sharing. 
Sharing knowledge about our systems and solutions to dynamic problems drives innovation, leading to more durable, creative and effective solutions. In short...

## How to Navigate the Kennisbank
1. Find your project under 'Repositories' 
2. In your project's repository, the main (readme) page contains further instructions. Typically, models, data and other project information are stored in separate folders. Depending on restrictions, you can view, download or contribute to these folders and its contents 
3. Other repositories contain additional information. Feel free to click through them to learn more!

## How to Join the Kennisbank Network
Our knowledge is open where possible. Whether you are Rijkswaterstaat, a contributing party, or an interested member of the public, you are able to join our network at an appropriate accessibility level. You can join in different ways, depending on what you'd like to do:   

### Accessing or downloading Kennisbank information
**If youd like to view and download publicly avialable data/models you do not need a Github account.** Simply navigate to the file in the correct repository, click on the green 'code' button

### Contributing your models, data or knowledge
If you would like to contribute to the Kennisbank, by for instance adding or editing files in respository, you will need to set up a github account (more info on that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)). Once you've done that, you can _clone_ or _fork_ the repository to download a local copy of its contents. You can then contribute your models, data, and knowledge through _push_, _pull_, or _merge_ requests (more details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). 

Note: depending on the repository _push_ and _merge_ privledges may require a request for write access. Similiarly, if you would like to contribute to the Kennisbank organization (not just one or more of its repositories) please email the organization admins at: peter@deltares.nl or johnkucharski@gmail.com with your github account name and description on your role or intentions. While the Kennisbank is open where possible it may also contain one or more privite repositories (due to partnering organizations requirements) if you would like to access one or more of the repositories please contact the organization admins.  

**Good Luck and Happy Collaborating!**
