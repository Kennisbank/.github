# Kennisbank

A place to share system dynamics models for infrastructure innovation in the Netherlands.

Our partners solve infrastructure problems, sometimes system dynamic models: improve our understnading the problems, identify what drives the system to change (dynamics), and formulate effective solutions.
These partners deposit some of these models in our Kennisbank (knowledge bank) to facilitate collaboration and sharing. 
Sharing knowledge about our systems and solutions to dynamic problems drives innovation, leading to more durable, creative and effective solutions. In short...

If you would like to contribute to the kennisbank, such as adding or editing the repositories, you will need to set up a github account (more info on that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)). Once you've done that, you can make requests to _fork_ or _pull_ repository contents to work on your doesktop, then _merge_ them back to update accessible parts of the repository (more details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). Some contents are protected and not openly shared - if you would like access, please email the admins at peter@deltares.nl or john@deltares.nl with your github account name and description on your role or intentions, and we can make you a member of the Kennisbank organisation with the appropriate permissions.   

**Good Luck and Happy Collaborating!**
